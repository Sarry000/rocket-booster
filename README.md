## About The Project

[cite_start]Rocket Booster is a game I developed using Unity and C# to apply and showcase my game development skills[cite: 8, 9]. [cite_start]The objective is to navigate a rocket through multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty[cite: 8]. Players must carefully control the rocket's physics-based movement and boosting to avoid crashing and successfully land on the designated platform to advance.

This project was a fantastic exercise in handling physics-based controllers, managing game states (win/loss), and designing a multi-level scene progression system in a game engine environment.

### Built With

* [cite_start]**Game Engine:** Unity Engine [cite: 8]
* [cite_start]**Language:** C# [cite: 9]

## Key Features

* [cite_start]**Physics-Based Movement:** Implemented C# scripts to control the rocket's rotation and thrust using Unity's `Rigidbody` component for a realistic feel[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Multi-Level Progression:** A structured level system that loads new scenes upon successful completion of the current stage, as described in the project's goal[cite: 8].
* **Collision Detection:** Custom collision handling scripts to detect crashes or successful landings, triggering the appropriate game-over or level-complete logic.
* [cite_start]**Asset Integration:** The project integrates various assets to enhance gameplay and user experience[cite: 9].

## How to Play

1.  **Clone the repository** and open the project in the Unity Hub.
2.  Open any of the `Level` scenes from the `Assets/Scenes` folder.
3.  Press the **Play** button in the editor.

**Controls:**
* **A / D** or **Left / Right Arrow Keys** to rotate the rocket.
* **Spacebar** to engage the main thruster.

## What I Learned

This project was a significant learning experience that strengthened my practical skills in several key areas:

* [cite_start]**C# Scripting for Gameplay:** Wrote modular C# scripts to handle complex behaviors like player input, physics application, and state management, reinforcing my object-oriented programming skills[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Unity Scene Management:** Learned to build a robust system for loading and transitioning between multiple game scenes, a fundamental concept for creating a multi-level game[cite: 8].
* **Physics (`Rigidbody`) Manipulation:** Gained hands-on experience applying forces and torque to game objects to create intuitive and challenging physics-based controls.
* **Unity Editor Workflow:** This project improved my proficiency with the Unity Editor, including working with Prefabs, managing assets, and designing levels.
